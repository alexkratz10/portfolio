        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hi, I'm Alex, I am a strategic problem-solver who bridges data, psychology, and technology to drive meaningful organizational change. 
            With a Master’s in Industrial-Organizational Psychology from the University of Maryland and leadership experience at NASA, 
            I’ve managed complex programs focused on workforce analytics, strategic planning, and operational performance. 
            My foundation in people science and process improvement informs everything I build, from dashboards to full-scale systems.
        </p>
        <p>
            At NASA, I led cross-functional initiatives to improve forecasting, hiring strategy, and program delivery. I developed tools in 
            Power BI, Python, and SQL; automated workflows with Alteryx; and collaborated across engineering, finance, and IT. 
            Now, I’m expanding my impact by growing my skills as a full-stack developer, combining front-end design and back-end logic to create user-friendly, 
            data-powered applications. My goal is to build tools that not only visualize insights, but deliver them where they matter most in the 
            hands of teams, decision-makers, and everyday users.
        </p>

        </div>
        <p>
            I'm especially drawn to projects that sit at the intersection of people, systems, and scalable design. Whether I’m managing a team, 
            analyzing a workforce, or coding an interface, I focus on empowering others through clarity, usability, and purpose. Outside of work, 
            you can find me spending time with family, playing soccer, or immersed in a D&D campaign.

        <h2>Projects</h2>

            <h3>Project 1: Business Management and Performance Office Development</h3>
            <p>During a major organizational shift from decentralized HR functions to an enterprise-wide model, I was tasked with establishing a Business 
                Management and Performance Office to support change management efforts. I collaborated closely with teams across Finance, Procurement, 
                Workforce Planning, and Accountability to break down silos and identify operational synergies. By designing and implementing comprehensive 
                operational performance and reporting frameworks, including a risk management process, I enhanced transparency and improved decision-making 
                across the organization.</h3>
            <p>Skills:  Organizational Design, Business Acumen, Program Management, Change Management, Organizational Development, People Management, Operational Reporting, KPIs, Risk Management</p>

            <h3>Project 2: Workforce Analytics Dashboard</h3>
            <p>To address the challenge of fragmented workforce data and inefficient reporting, I developed an interactive Workforce Analytics Dashboard 
                using Power BI. I integrated data from multiple HR systems and automated data refresh processes with Python, streamlining reporting workflows. 
                This solution empowered leadership with real-time hiring insights, enabling more accurate workforce planning and reducing manual reporting 
                efforts by 75%.</p>

            <h3>Project 3: NASA Workforce Optimization & Reshaping Initiative</h3>
            <p>Handpicked by C-suite leadership to lead a strategic Workforce Optimization and Reshaping initiative, I managed cross-functional collaboration 
                with Finance, Procurement, and HR to gather and validate complex workforce and financial data. I spearheaded scenario planning and workforce 
                modeling efforts to forecast organizational impacts. The initiative culminated in an interactive dashboard that provided leadership with 
                actionable insights, driving informed strategic workforce decisions and optimizing resource allocation.</p>
